/*
 *Quick Sort: This algorithm is also based on the divide and conquer approach. It reduces the space complexity and removes the use 
 *of auxiliary array used in merge sort.
 *
 * we learn about insertion sort algorithm which takes O(n2) time complexity, which makes it impractical to use while programming. 
In this  we will learn about quick sort algorithm which has average case time comlexity O(nlogn)which is better as compared to insertion 
sort algorithm. 

Quick sort algorithm is based on divide and conquer algorithm in which
Divide -  Partition (rearrange) the array into two subarrays such that each element of left sub array is less than
 or equal to a pivot element, which is, in turn, less than or equal to each element of right subarray.

Conquer - Sort the two subarrays i.e left subarray and right subarray by recursive calls to quicksort.

Combine - Because the subarrays are already sorted, no work is needed to combine them.(Quicksort works in place)

Quick sort is not stable sort as it does not preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output array.

Time Complexity
As we know based on pivot element the input array get divided into two subarray and further we sort left subarray and right subarray 
by recursive calls to quicksort. Assume if the left subarray does not contain any element or right subarray does not contain any element.
In such cases, the time complexity of quick sort becomes O(n2). 
Hence the worst casse time complexity of quick sort algorithm is O(n2). 
The best case and average case time complexity of quick sort algorithm is O(nlogn).

Use rand_partition instead of partition function in quick_sort function to reduce the time complexity of this algorithm.

The worst case time complexity of this algorithm is O( n2 ), but as this is randomized algorithm, 
its time complexity fluctuates between O( n2 ) and O(n (log n) ) and mostly it comes out to be O( n (log n)) .

Space Complexity

As quick sort algorithm uses inplace sorting where no extra space is required as well as quick sort use recursion which
requires the extra space are the log(n) stack frames. Hence the space complexity of quick sort algorithm is O(logn).

It is Unstable Sort
